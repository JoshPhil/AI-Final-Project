# AI-Final-Project

Abstract:
This project uses the Abalone Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository to implement a machine learning model that predicts the age of abalone from physical measurements. The PyCaret library, an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python that automates machine learning workflows was used. The PyCaret library was used to get the data, set up the environment, create a model, tune the model, plot the model for analyzing the performance of a trained model, finalize the model, use the model to predict unseen data, and finally save the model for future use. After using PyCaret to compare models, the best model, in this case, was Bayesian Ridge with an R^2 performance metric of about 0.52.
